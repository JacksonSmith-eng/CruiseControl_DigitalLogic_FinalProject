# CruiseControl_DigitalLogic_FinalProject
Cruise Control | Digital Logic

The goal of this project was to create a cruise control system for a car.
The program was written using Verilog.
The program was to be simulated on an Intel DE2i-150 FPGA board.
Car's speed was displayed on 7-segment displays, while current state of the system was displayed with LEDs.
